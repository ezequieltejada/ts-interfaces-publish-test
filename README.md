ts-interfaces-publish-test
==========================

What is this?
-------------

This is a test repo that contains a TypeScript interface to publish on NPM.

See `index.d.ts` for the interface, and see `package.json` for the npm info.

You can install it with:

```
npm install ts-interfaces-publish-test
```

Why?
----

I saw this question on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/bcaqi0/sharing_types_with_team/

And thought it would be something interesting to try out, and maybe I could answer their question in the process.
